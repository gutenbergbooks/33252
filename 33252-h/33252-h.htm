<p>PREFACE</p>

<p>This little collection is intended as a companion volume
to "Greek Sculpture," a previous issue of the Riverside
Art Series. The two sets of pictures, studied side by
side, illustrate clearly the difference in the spirit animating
the two art periods represented.</p>

<p>The Tuscan sculpture of the Renaissance was developed
under a variety of forms, of which as many as possible
are included in the limits of our book: the equestrian
statue, the sepulchral monument, the ideal statue of
saint and hero, as well as various forms of decorative
art applied to the beautifying of churches and public
buildings both without and within.</p>

<h3>I. ON SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF TUSCAN SCULPTURE<br>
IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>"The Italian sculptors of the earlier half of the fifteenth
century are more than mere forerunners of the
great masters of its close, and often reach perfection
within the narrow limits which they chose to impose on
their work. Their sculpture shares with the paintings
of Botticelli and the churches of Brunelleschi that profound
expressiveness, that intimate impress of an indwelling
soul, which is the peculiar fascination of the
art of Italy in that century."</p>

<p>These words of Walter Pater define admirably the
quality which, in varying degree, runs through the work
of men of such differing methods as Donatello, the della
Robbia, Mino da Fiesole, and Rossellino. It is the quality
of expressiveness as distinguished from that abstract
or generalized character which belongs to Greek sculpture.
Greek sculpture, it is true, taught some of these
artists how to study nature, but it did not satisfy Christian
ideals. The subjects demanded of the Tuscans were
entirely foreign to Greek experience. The saints and
martyrs of the Christian era were at the opposite pole from
the gods and heroes of antiquity. Hence the aim of the
new sculpture was the manifestation of the soul, as that
of the classic art had been the glorification of the body.</p>

<p>Jacopo della Quercia was one of the oldest of the sculptors
whose work extended into the fifteenth century, being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
already twenty-five years of age when that century began.
Standing thus in the period of transition between the old
and the new, his work unites the influence of mediæval
tradition with a distinctly new element. His bas-reliefs
on the portal of S. Petronio at Bologna are probably
his most characteristic work. The tomb of Ilaria del
Carretto is in a class by itself: "In composition, the
gravest and most tranquil of his works, and in conception,
full of beauty and feeling."<a name="FNanchor_01" id="FNanchor_01"></a><a href="#Footnote_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Donatello is undoubtedly the greatest name in Italian
sculpture previous to Michelangelo. The kinship between
these two men was felicitously expressed in Vasari's
quotation from "the most learned and very reverend"
Don Vicenzo Borghini: "Either the spirit of Donato
worked in Buonarroti, or that of Buonarroti first acted in
Donato." Vitality, force, action, suggestiveness, character,
such are the words which spring to the lips in the
presence of both masters.</p>

<p>The range of Donatello's art was phenomenal, from
works of such magnitude as the equestrian statue of
Gattamelata, to the decorative panels for the altar of S.
Antonio at Padua. At times he was an uncompromising
realist, as in his statue of the bald old man, the Zuccone,
who figured as King David. Again he showed
himself capable of lofty idealism, as in the beautiful and
heroic St. George. Which way his own tastes leaned
we may judge from his favorite asseveration, "By my
Zuccone." The point is that it mattered nothing to him
whether his model was beautiful or ugly, whether he
wrought out an ideal of his imagination or studied the
character of an actual individual; his first care was to
make the figure live. In consequence his art has what a
critic has called "a robustness and a sanity" which have
made it "a wellspring of inspiration to lesser men."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
The only subject practically left out of Donatello's
work was woman. Children afforded him all the material
he needed for the more decorative forms of his art.
For the rest the problems which interested him most were
perhaps best worked out in the study of the male figure.</p>

<p>A recent biographer of Donatello, Hope Rea, points
out some interesting characteristics of his technical workmanship.
In every work subsequent to his St. Mark,
"the hair," she says, "is conspicuous by its appearance
of living growth." And again, explaining the excellence
of his drapery, she shows how he went beyond the ordinary
consideration of the general flow and line of the
stuffs, to a study of the sections of the folds. Hence
drapery with him "is not only an arrangement of lines
for decorative effect, or a covering for the figure, but it
is a beauty in itself, filled with the living air."</p>

<p>Nanni di Banco is a name naturally associated with
that of Donatello, not only on account of the friendship
between the two, but from the fact that both worked on
the church of Or San Michele. Nanni was one of the
smaller men whose work is overshadowed by the fame of
a great contemporary. His art has not sufficient distinction
to give it a prominent place; yet it is not without
good qualities. Marcel Reymond insists that the public
has not yet appreciated the just merits of this neglected
sculptor. In his opinion the St. Philip was the inspiration
of Donatello's St. Mark, while Nanni's St. Eloi had
an influence upon St. George.</p>

<p>With Luca della Robbia began the "reign of the bas-relief,"
as Marcel Reymond characterizes the period of
fifty years between Donatello and Michelangelo. Women
and children were the special subjects of this sculptor's
art, and it is perhaps in the Madonna and Child that we
see his most characteristic touch. How well he could
represent spirited action, we see in some of the panels of

the organ gallery. How dignified was his sense of repose,
is seen in the lunette of the Ascension.</p>

<p>Much as he cared for expression,--"expression carried
to its highest intensity of degree," as Walter Pater
put it,--he never found it necessary to secure this expression
at the cost of beauty. That he studied nature
at first hand his works are clear evidence, but that did
not preclude the choice of attractive subjects. His style
is "so sober and contained," writes a recent critic, "so
delicate and yet so healthy, so lovely and yet so free
from prettiness, so full of sentiment, and devoid of sentimentality,
that it is hard to find words for any critical
characterization."<a name="FNanchor_02" id="FNanchor_02"></a><a href="#Footnote_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Simplicity and nobility," the words
of Cavalucci and Molinier, is perhaps the best phrase in
which to sum up the art of Luca della Robbia.</p>

<p>In his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, the founder of
the school had a successor whose best work is worthy of
the master's teaching. If he lacked the simplicity and
severity of the older man, he surpassed him in depth of
Christian sentiment. Sometimes, it is true, his tenderness
verges on weakness, his devoutness on pietism. If
we are tempted to charge him with monotony we must
remember what pressure was brought upon a man whose
works attained such immense popularity. The bambini
of the Foundling Hospital and the Meeting of St. Francis
and St. Dominick show the high level to which his
art could rise.</p>

<p>Antonio Rossellino and Mino da Fiesole may be classed
together as sculptors to whom decorative effect was of
first importance; they loved line and form for their intrinsic
beauty. They delighted in elaborate and well
ordered compositions. Elegance of design, delicacy and
refinement in handling, are invariable qualities of their
work. Such qualities were especially to be desired in
the making of those sepulchral monuments which were so
numerous in their period. Of the many fine works of
this class in Tuscany each of these two sculptors contributed
at least one of the best examples.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
It is superfluous to point out that the sweetness of these
sculptors is perilously near the insipid, their grace too
often formal. We are brought to realize the true greatness
of the men when we behold the grave and tranquil
beauty of the effigy of the Cardinal of Portugal, or the
vigorous characterization of the bust of Bishop Salutati.</p>

<p>It is John Addington Symonds who says the final word
when he declares that the charm of the works of such men
as Mino and Rossellino "can scarcely be defined except
by similes." And these are the images which this master
of similes calls up to our mind as we contemplate their
works: "The innocence of childhood, the melody of a lute
or a song bird as distinguished from the music of an
orchestra, the rathe tints of early dawn, cheerful light on
shallow streams, the serenity of a simple and untainted
nature that has never known the world."</p>

<h3>II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</h3>

<p>There are but few works devoted exclusively to the
subject of Italian Renaissance sculpture. For many years
American students seeking information in this direction
have relied chiefly upon the works of C. C. Perkins:
"Tuscan Sculptors" (2 vols.), London, 1864; "Italian
Sculptors" (in Northern, Southern and Eastern Italy),
London, 1868; and finally the volume which unites and
revises the material of both earlier works, "Historical
Handbook of Italian Sculpture," New York, 1883.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
The recent work of Marcel Reymond, "La Sculpture
Florentine," Florence, 1898, has been heartily welcomed
by students of all nationalities. It consists of four volumes,
all well illustrated, devoted respectively to: (1)
Les Pr&eacute;d&eacute;cesseurs de l'Ecole Florentine et la Sculpture
Florentine au XIV<span style="vertical-align:super;">e</span> si&egrave;cle [The Precursors of the Florentine
School and Florentine Sculpture of the 14th Century].
(2) Premi&egrave;re moiti&eacute; du XV<span style="vertical-align:super;">e</span> si&egrave;cle [First half
of the 15th century]. (3) Seconde moiti&eacute; du XV<span style="vertical-align:super;">e</span> si&egrave;cle
[Second half of the 15th century]. (4) Le XVI<span style="vertical-align:super;">e</span> si&egrave;cle et
les Successeurs de l'Ecole Florentine [The 16th Century
and the Successors of the Florentine School]. As it
has not been translated into English this work is not
so widely read by the general public as it should be, but
it is probably to be found in most large libraries.</p>

<p>A newly published book, "Italian Sculpture of the
Renaissance," by L. J. Freeman, M. A., appears just as
this volume goes to press. It is a brief survey, critical
and interpretative, of the principal works of the
most prominent Florentine sculptors of the period, with
some account of the characteristics of the early and later
Renaissance work. Some forty fine illustrations elucidate
the study.</p>

<p>Of the general works on the history of art from which
material on our subject may be drawn, the most important
is of course Vasari's "Lives." In the recently revised
English version, edited by E. H. and E. W. Blashfield
and A. A. Hopkins (New York, 1897), are some valuable
footnotes summing up the characteristics of the individual
sculptors.</p>

<p>Of inestimable value for purposes of serious study are
the volumes by Eug&egrave;ne M&uuml;ntz, "Histoire de l'Art pendant
la Renaissance." The material bearing on the sculptors
illustrated in this present collection is found in his
volume devoted to "Les Primitifs" (Paris, 1889). Those
to whom the French text presents no difficulty will derive
much benefit from the study of this book, which may be
consulted in the large public libraries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
A book available to all, and of a delightfully popular
nature, is the volume on "The Fine Arts" in John
Addington Symonds's series of The Renaissance in Italy.
This writer had a remarkable gift for putting much suggestive
comment into a compact and readable form.</p>

<p>General histories of sculpture allotting a proportionate
space to the consideration of the Italian sculptors of the
Renaissance are, by Lucy Baxter, "Sculpture, Renaissance
and Modern" (New York, 1891); L&uuml;bke, "History
of Sculpture," translated from the German by F. E.
Bunnett (London, 1878); Allan Marquand and A. L.
Frothingham, "Textbook of the History of Sculpture"
(New York, 1896).</p>

<p>A special study of the work of Donatello is made by
Hope Rea in a volume of the series of Handbooks of the
Great Masters in Painting and Sculpture. A complete
list of the sculptor's works is given. Luca della Robbia
is the subject of two important French works: by Cavalucci
and Molinier, "Les Della Robbia" (Paris, 1884);
by Marcel Reymond, "Les Della Robbia" (Florence,
1897). There is a chapter on Luca della Robbia in
Walter Pater's "Studies in the History of the Renaissance"
(1890), and another in Mrs. Van Rensselaer's
"Six Portraits" (Boston, 1889).</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant has written pleasantly both of Donatello
and of Luca della Robbia in "The Makers of Florence."</p>

<h3>III. HISTORICAL DIRECTORY OF THE WORKS IN<br>
THIS COLLECTION.</h3>

<p>Frontispiece. <a href="#Frontispiece"><i>Il Marzocco</i></a> (the heraldic lion of Florence).
(Donatello.) Made of pietra serena and originally
placed on the <i>ringhiera</i> of the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence.
Now in the National Museum (Bargello) of that city, while
a bronze copy occupies its place in front of the palace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
1. <a href="#MusicalAngels_img"><i>Musical Angels.</i></a> (Donatello.) Bronze bas-reliefs
from the high altar of S. Antonio, Padua. Ordered in
1448. Completed in 1450. Marcel Reymond holds that
the execution of these reliefs was committed to assistants.
In 1576 a new altar was ordered, and Donatello's
bronzes were dispersed. In 1895 a reconstruction of
Donatello's altar was made, setting the parts in place
according to what is supposed to have been the original
design.</p>

<p>2. <a href="#StPhilip_img"><i>St. Philip.</i></a> (Nanni di Banco.) Marble statue in
niche on outside of Or San Michele, Florence. The date
is uncertain; Marcel Reymond considers it one of Nanni's
oldest works, placing it before 1408.</p>

<p>3. <a href="#StJohn_img"><i>St. John the Baptist.</i></a> (Donatello.) Bas-relief in
pietra serena in the National Museum (Bargello), Florence.
No date is assigned.</p>

<p>4. <a href="#JesusJohn_img"><i>The Infant Jesus and St. John.</i></a> (Mino da Fiesole.)
Detail of marble altarpiece in alto relievo in cathedral
of Fiesole, being a part of the monument of Bishop Salutati.
Ordered in 1462.</p>

<p>5. <a href="#BoysWithCymbals_img"><i>Boys with Cymbals.</i></a> (Lucca della Robbia.) One of
the marble bas-reliefs ornamenting the organ gallery for
the Florence cathedral. Organ gallery begun in 1431,
finished 1440. Removed from cathedral in 1688. Reliefs
put in Uffizi Gallery 1882, and then in the Bargello.
Thence taken to the museum of the Duomo, where they
are now to be seen, set up in place on the reconstructed
gallery.</p>

<p>6. <a href="#Carretto_img"><i>Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto (Detail).</i></a> (Jacopo
della Quercia.) Marble tomb in the cathedral of Lucca.
Milanese dates it 1413, but Ridolfi's description of the
Lucca cathedral places Jacopo's work there in 1406 or
1407, and M&uuml;ntz thinks this date conclusive.</p>

<p>7. <a href="#MadonnaChild_img"><i>Madonna and Child (Detail).</i></a> (Luca della Robbia.)
Glazed terra cotta lunette over the door of a building
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
(now a shop) in the Via dell' Agnolo, Florence. Considered
by Marcel Reymond the most difficult of Luca's
work to date. According to Dr. Bode, executed before
1431; according to Allan Marquand, between 1430 and
1440; according to Marcel Reymond, towards 1450.</p>

<p>8. <a href="#StFranStDom_img"><i>Meeting of St. Francis and St. Dominick.</i></a> (Andrea
della Robbia.) Glazed terra cotta lunette in the Loggia
of San Paolo, Florence. Classified by Marcel Reymond
under Andrea's third manner, because distinguished by
perfect knowledge of artistic principles.</p>

<p>9. <a href="#StGeorge_img"><i>St. George.</i></a> (Donatello.) Marble statue originally
designed for a niche on the church of Or San Michele,
Florence. Executed in 1416 at the order of the Guild
of Armorers. In 1887 it was removed to the National
Museum, Florence, to preserve it from injury by exposure
to the weather. A bronze copy was substituted for
it on the church.</p>

<p>10. <a href="#Bambino_img"><i>Bambino.</i></a> (Andrea della Robbia.) One of a
series of glazed terra cotta medallions on the fa&ccedil;ade of
the Foundling Hospital, Florence. Judged by its relation
to the art of Luca della Robbia, this is among the early
works of Andrea. From certain data in the history of
the hospital, Cavalucci reckons that it was executed about
the year 1463.</p>

<p>11. <a href="#Annunciation_img"><i>The Annunciation.</i></a> (Andrea della Robbia.) Altarpiece
at La Verna. Marcel Reymond says that from
the beauty of style and the advanced knowledge of technique
exhibited here, this work must belong to Andrea's
maturity, that is, in the neighborhood of his fortieth year.
It is classified by Reymond in Andrea's "first manner."</p>

<p>12. <a href="#Ascension_img"><i>The Ascension.</i></a> (Luca della Robbia.) Enamelled
terra cotta lunette, decorating tympanum of door of sacristy
in the cathedral at Florence. The first work in this
material by Luca of which we have the date, 1446.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
13. <a href="#TombCard_img"><i>Tomb of the Cardinal of Portugal (Detail).</i></a> (Antonio
Rossellino.) Tomb in colored marble in the church
of San Miniato, Florence. Ordered in 1461.</p>

<p>14. <a href="#Equestrian_img"><i>Equestrian statue of Gattamelata.</i></a> (Donatello.)
In the Piazza del Santo, Padua. Commission given 1444.
Work begun 1446. Statue set up, 1453. Erected at
the expense of Gattamelata's son, Gio. Antonio.</p>

<p>15. <a href="#Shrine_img"><i>Shrine.</i></a> (Mino da Fiesole.) A marble tabernacle,
decorated in mezzo-relievo and originally made for
the nuns of the convent of the Murate. Removed in
1815 to S. Croce, Florence. No date is assigned to it.</p>

<h3>IV. TABLE OF BIOGRAPHICAL DATA.</h3>

<p><i>Jacopo di Pietro d'Angelo</i>, of La Quercia Gossa, a
castello once near Siena and since destroyed. Born 1371;
died 1438. Variously stated to have been a scholar of
Maestro Goro and of Luca di Giovanni. Milanese believes
that these claims are groundless, and that Jacopo
was a pupil of his own father, who was a goldsmith. Best
known for his marble reliefs ornamenting the portal of
S. Petronio, Bologna.</p>

<p><i>Nanni di Banco.</i> Son of Antonio di Banco, who
was at work in the Florence Cathedral in 1406. He is
known to have been considerably older than Donatello,
and Marcel Reymond suggests the date 1374 as the
probable year of his birth. Died 1421.</p>

<p><i>Donatello.</i> The familiar name applied to Donato di
Niccol&ograve; di Betti Bardi. Born in Florence, 1386; died
in Florence, 1466. His visit to Rome in company with
Brunelleschi has been called the most important of the
initial steps in the revival of antiquity in art. The
friendship and patronage of Cosmo de' Medici brought
the artist many commissions.</p>

<p><i>Luca di Simone di Marco della Robbia.</i> Born in
Florence, 1399 or 1400; died 1482.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
<i>Andrea della Robbia</i>, nephew of Luca. Born 1435;
died 1525.</p>

<p><i>Antonio Rossellino.</i> One of the five sons of Matteo
di Domenico Gambarelli, all being artists. Born in Settignano
in 1427; died about 1499.</p>

<p><i>Mino di Giovanni di Mino</i>, usually called <i>Mino da
Fiesole</i>. Born in 1431 in Poppi, in the Casentino, a
district between the sources of the Arno and Tiber, north
of Arezzo. Died in 1484. He was a friend of Desiderio
da Settignano, but probably not one of his pupils.</p>

<h3>MUSICAL ANGELS</h3>
<h3>BY DONATELLO</h3>

<p>In the western part of Italy, lying a little north
of the centre, is the district known as Tuscany.
Here, in the valley of the Arno, is the city of Florence,
glorious with her storied palaces and churches.
Around her are clustered Pistoja and Lucca, Pisa
and Leghorn, Siena and Arezzo, all notable towns
in Italian history. Here, too, is Carrara, with its
stores of beautiful marble.</p>

<p>It was from this little district of Tuscany that
the sculptors came forth who have helped to make
Italy famous as the birthplace of modern art. The
development of Tuscan sculpture covered a period of
some three centuries, beginning with the Pisan Niccol&ograve;,
who worked between the years 1220 and 1270,
and culminating with the great Florentine Michelangelo,
who died in 1564. We shall study in this
little collection a few works of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It was the time called by historians the Renaissance,
which means literally "the new birth." The
world was awakening from the long sleep of the
Middle Ages, and Italy was the first to be aroused.
Certain adventurous spirits began to ponder the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">[02]</a></span>
possibility of a new continent beyond the sea. There
was a great revival of learning, accompanied by a
passionate love of the beautiful. Schools of art
were established throughout the length of Italy.</p>

<p>In other volumes of this series we have learned
how the churches, palaces, and public buildings
were filled with paintings.
<a name="FNanchor_03" id="FNanchor_03"></a><a href="#Footnote_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
We shall now see that
sculpture also contributed much to the adornment
of the cities. Statues, busts, and bas-reliefs, in marble,
bronze, and terra-cotta, ornamented many buildings
both without and within.</p>

<p>Our illustration shows two panels from the series
of twelve bronze reliefs on the front of a church
altar. Two little boy angels are making music with
their pipes. The companion panels are also filled
with musical angels, some singing and others playing
on various instruments.</p>

<p>The New Testament begins and ends with the
music of angels. The birth of Jesus is heralded by
a multitude of the heavenly host singing "Glory to
God in the highest." The golden city of St. John's
vision is filled with "the voice of harpers, harping
with their harps," in the new song before the throne
of God. Thence has arisen the beautiful custom of
artists to represent angels as musicians.</p>

<p>The child angels of our picture have tiny pointed
wings as a sign of their heavenly origin. Certainly
we cannot imagine such buoyant little creatures
treading the earth like mortals. One stands on tip-toe
like a bird poised for flight. The other skips
through the air with joyous motion. The head of
one is encircled by a halo, the emblem of purity.
The other wears a fillet of flowers over his curls.
Each carries two little pipes, the simplest of musical
instruments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">[05]</a></span>

<p>It was long ago in the childhood of the race that
some shepherd, plucking a reed from the bank of a
stream, first found that the hollow stem had a voice
of its own. The pipe thereafter became a favorite
instrument among primitive people. We read in
the Old Testament Scriptures that the ancient Hebrews
used it in the celebration of their festivities.
At the Greek festivals also the pipers had a place
in the procession of musicians.</p>

<p>Our angel pipers are blowing lustily with puffing
cheeks--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0" style="text-indent:8em;">"Such sweet</span>
<span class="i0">Soft notes as yet musician's cunning</span>
<span class="i0">Never gave the enraptured air."</span>
</div></div>

<p>They are genuine musicians, not children playing
with the pipes as with toys. They move to the
rhythm of their piping, their lifted faces expressing
their delight. Their thin garments cling to their
figures, and the loose ends flutter about them.</p>

<p>Every line of the modelling is beautiful, the poise
of the figures full of rhythmic grace. The angel at
the left stands in profile, with face slightly turned
away from the spectator. The right hand figure
skips directly out of his panel, swinging lithely
about towards the left, as he moves. The outlines
of both figures describe long fine curves, with which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">[06]</a></span>
the edges of the drapery run parallel. In the drawing
of the right hand angel we may trace delicate
patterns of interlacing ovals.</p>

<p>Some portions of the work seem to be modelled
in very high relief. The limbs, we are told, are in
low relief, supported on a metal back, an inch or so
thick, by which they are thrown out to a proper distance
from the background.</p>

<p>The altar to which our panels belong is in the
church of S. Antonio, Padua, and was executed by
the Florentine sculptor, Donatello, in 1450. The
entire scheme of decoration is very elaborate. On
the front is a row of musical angels, in which the
panels here reproduced occupy opposite ends. Above
these are five reliefs of larger size; and still higher
are seven life-size statues of saints. The whole is
surmounted by a crucifix. Even the back of the
altar is ornamented with reliefs, and the work is
an example of the spirit of the age, which thought
nothing too rich or beautiful for the purposes of
worship.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>ST. PHILIP</h3>
<h3>BY NANNI DI BANCO</h3>

<p>St. Philip was one of the first group of disciples
whom Jesus called to his service. He was a native
of Bethsaida in Galilee, but we do not know what
occupation he pursued there. There is a tradition
that he was a chariot driver, and in any case he was
certainly a laboring man like all of the twelve.
Having attached himself to Jesus he began at once
to work in his cause. He persuaded Nathanael to
come and see the Master, and thereby won a new
adherent.<a name="FNanchor_04" id="FNanchor_04"></a><a href="#Footnote_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Philip was not spiritually minded, like John, nor
impetuous, like Peter, but in his own way he wanted
to know the truth. Perhaps he was a little slower
than others to grasp religious teaching. It may be
that he was franker than many in confessing that
he did not understand.</p>

<p>He and Thomas were somewhat alike in this respect,
and once, when Jesus was talking of departing
to the Heavenly Father, both interrupted him with
questions. Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father
and it sufficeth us." "Have I been so long time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">[08]</a></span>
with you and yet hast thou not known me?" replied
Jesus. "He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father."<a name="FNanchor_05" id="FNanchor_05"></a><a href="#Footnote_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Apparently Philip learned his lesson well, for we
read in traditional history of his faithful missionary
services in later life. He was twenty years in Scythia
preaching the gospel. Then he went to Hieropolis
in Phrygia, where the people worshipped a serpent.
The apostle drove the serpent away, but the pagan
priests sought his life in revenge. He was bound
to a cross and stoned to death, praying even in his
agony for his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_06" id="FNanchor_06"></a><a href="#Footnote_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The statue of St. Philip in our illustration shows
him as a somewhat commonplace-looking man with
heavy features. It accords with the usual account
of him that his face should not be particularly intellectual.
His attitude is full of dignity, and
denotes a well-balanced character. The large well-knit
hands are those of an artisan. He is of about
middle age, as the artists usually represent him. A
plain man of good common sense and sterling
worth--this was Philip both in fact and in the
statue.</p>

<p>In pictures and statues the apostles nearly always
carry the symbols of their identity. St. Philip's emblem
is the cross, but it is here dispensed with, and
we have only the Latin inscription to show us who
he is.</p>

The statue stands in a niche, and is one of a series
ornamenting the outside of the church of Or San
Michele in Florence. In building this church all
the merchants and artisans of the city contributed
to support the work. Each trade was at that time
represented by a guild or association whose members
united to advance their common business interests.<a name="FNanchor_07" id="FNanchor_07"></a><a href="#Footnote_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
These various guilds furnished the statues for the
niches, each supplying the figure of its own patron
saint. St. Philip was the gift of the Guild of Hosiers,
and was executed by the sculptor Nanni di
Banco.</p>

<p>Donatello had at first been approached by the
guild, but considering his price exorbitant they gave
the order to Nanni, who promised to accept any
terms they decided upon. When the statue was
done, however, the sculptor demanded a sum larger
than the price of Donatello. The latter was now
called upon to act as referee, and he set a still higher
price upon the work. The Hosiers were indignant.
"Why," they asked, "had Donatello rated Nanni's
work at a higher price than his own, which would
have undoubtedly been better?" "Because," replied
the great sculptor, laughing, "being less
skilful than I, he has worked harder, and therefore
deserves more pay." A compromise was effected,
and the statue set in place.</p>


<p>That Donatello could indeed have made a better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">[12]</a></span>
statue we shall presently see when we study his St.
George, designed for the same church. St. Philip
lacks distinction, and it has not the animation which
the greater sculptor knew how to impart to his work.
Nevertheless it has certain artistic qualities which
make it worthy of Donatello's championship.</p>

<p>The lines of the drapery are well studied. Apparently
Nanni had learned something in this respect
from the Greek sculpture. Where draperies
are simple and hang in long unbroken lines, the
effect is impressive and dignified. When they are
voluminous and broken, they lose in dignity. Good
art is always simple and has no meaningless lines.</p>

<p>We are interested in examining the niche in which
the statue is set. It is Gothic in design, and with
its pointed top and side pinnacles recalls the cathedral
windows in northern Europe. An architectural
frame of this sort is often called a tabernacle, being
in fact a miniature church in form. In the triangular
space at the top is a bas-relief figure in half
length which seems to represent Christ. The base
is ornamented with an arabesque or scroll design,
flanked at each end by the arms of the Hosiers'
Guild. The side pillars have rich Corinthian capitals.
Just inside are twisted pillars of curious workmanship.</p>

<p>Our illustration also shows a portion of the wall
against which the niche is placed. We see that the
church is built of stone, set in square blocks. On
each side of the niche is a metal ring through which
torches were thrust.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST</h3>
<h3>BY DONATELLO</h3>

<p>In the hill country of Jud&aelig;a lived the priest
Zacharias and his wife, Elisabeth, who were the
parents of St. John the Baptist. They were pious
people, "walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord, blameless." One day, as
Zacharias was ministering in his office in the temple,
an angel brought him the glad tidings that he was
to have a son. "Thou shalt call his name John,"
said the vision, "and thou shalt have joy and gladness,
and many shall rejoice at his birth."</p>

<p>A great career was promised for the coming child.
He was to be a preacher filled with spiritual power.
Like the old prophet Elias, he was to turn the hearts
of the people to God, and to prepare the way for
the Christ. As a sign that the angel's words were
true, Zacharias was stricken dumb until his son was
born. Then "his tongue was loosed, and he spake
and praised God."</p>

<p>The neighbors marvelled at the mystery of John's
birth, and they saw that "the hand of the Lord was
with him." "And the child grew and waxed strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">[14]</a></span>
in spirit," until he came to manhood.<a name="FNanchor_08" id="FNanchor_08"></a><a href="#Footnote_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Then was
fulfilled the angel's prophecy concerning him. He
became a great preacher, and multitudes flocked to
hear him.</p>

<p>John's manner of life was like that of a hermit.
He dwelt in the wilderness about the river Jordan,
wearing a garment of camel's hair bound about his
loins with a leathern girdle. His food was locusts
and wild honey. He gathered his audiences in the
open air and baptised his disciples in the river.</p>

<p>Though stern in his teachings he became for a
time very popular. Yet he always spoke of his
own work with great humility. "There cometh
one mightier than I after me," he said.<a name="FNanchor_09" id="FNanchor_09"></a><a href="#Footnote_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This was
Jesus, who, on presenting himself for baptism, was
greeted by John as the "Lamb of God." The
prophet's mission was now accomplished. He was
soon after thrown into prison and beheaded, at the
order of King Herod, whose sins he had openly
rebuked.</p>

<p>The story of the Baptist's life brings readily before
the imagination the strange figure of the man.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It is not so easy to fancy how he might have looked
as a boy. The bas-relief of our illustration shows
us what form the idea took in the mind of the
sculptor Donatello.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">[17]</a></span>
The little fellow seems tall and slender for his
years, as if he had stretched his limbs by running
much in the open air. The face is somewhat
serious, but perfectly childish. The lips are parted
in a half smile. He has a good forehead, and is an
independent thinker. He impresses us as a straightforward
character, a boy to like and trust.</p>

<p>It would be too much to say that he shows the
making of a great man. It is enough that he is an
honest, healthy boy with a mind of his own. He is
hardly pretty, but he is very interesting. The hair
is his most charming feature, waving in little tendrils
over the head. He is not plump enough for
his figure to show fine curves. On the contrary,
the modelling is on rather severe lines, as if in keeping
with the character.</p>

<p>Certain well understood signs show who he is.
The circle about his head is the halo, the symbol
of a sacred character. The skin garment fastened
at the shoulder reminds us of the strange clothing
John wore in the desert. The tall cross is the emblem
of the prophet, as a forerunner of the crucified
one.</p>

<p>Donatello's art covered a wide range of subjects,
but in none was he more at home than in representing
children. He has been called "the poet of
child-life." There are interesting points of comparison
between the example before us and the
Musical Angels of the altar at Padua. St. John
the Baptist is evidently a real little boy, transferred
to the stone just as he was. The piping angels, on
the other hand, are child ideals, without counterpart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">[18]</a></span>
in real life. St. John's large ear, with its irregularly
bent rim, and his straight upper lip, are features
such as an artist must certainly have copied,
not invented. The angel faces, on the other hand,
are moulded in the perfect curves which originate
in the imagination of the artist. Donatello was,
above all things else, a close student of human
nature. Sometimes, indeed, he chose very unattractive
models, and reproduced them so faithfully
that the realism is almost painful. His artistic eye
was always open to new impressions. Perhaps, one
day as he walked through the streets of Florence,
he noticed among the children playing there this
little fellow of the long neck and pensive face.
"Ecco," said he, to himself, "il Giovannino."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The child's face and bearing had a quaint seriousness
precisely suited to the character.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how the sculptor's art has made
the little boy seem actually alive in the bas-relief.
The hair is executed with the skill peculiar to Donatello,
and seems to grow from the head. Such
studies from real life--<i>genre</i> studies, as they are
called--were lessons which prepared the artist for
higher works of idealism. The little St. John may
have been the original material for some of the angel
figures.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>THE INFANT JESUS AND ST. JOHN</h3>
<h3>BY MINO DA FIESOLE</h3>

<p>Jesus and St. John the Baptist were of nearly the
same age, and there was a peculiar tie between them.
Their mothers, Mary and Elizabeth, were cousins,
and before the boys were born the two women had
confided in each other their hopes for the future of
their children. Angelic messengers had predicted a
remarkable destiny for both boys. Jesus was to rule
over an everlasting kingdom, and John was to be
his prophet preparing the way for him. These
were secrets which the outside world could not have
understood, and Mary paid a visit to her kinswoman
that they might talk of them together.</p>

<p>As John's home was in the hill country and Jesus
was born in the town of Bethlehem, we do not know
how soon the boys met. It might be supposed that
Mary and Elizabeth would be eager to bring them
together. While the mothers took council on the
training of their sons, the children would be at play.</p>

<p>The little ones were, we believe, brought up quite
simply, with no sense that they were different from
other children. Jesus was a natural leader. We
remember how he surprised his mother at the age
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">[20]</a></span>
of twelve by asserting his own judgment.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Among
his playfellows he must have shown much earlier
that he was the one to take the first place. John
was doubtless taught by his mother to defer to his
little cousin. He was not lacking in spirit himself,
but he could sometimes be very humble. In his
manhood he spoke of Jesus as one whose shoe's
latchet he was not worthy to unloose.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It is pleasant to picture the two children together
in our fancy, and we do not wonder that artists have
liked the subject.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Our illustration shows us the
theme wrought in marble. The child Jesus sits on
the steps, and the little St. John approaching kneels
in adoration. We see at once the religious meaning
of the artist: the relation between the two in after
life is foreshadowed in this imaginary incident.
Each child carries the symbol of his character. A
halo behind the head of Jesus signifies his divine
origin. He holds on his knee a globe surmounted
by a cross, in token that he who was crucified shall
be the ruler of the world. In the symbol of the
globe the old artists anticipated the later discoveries
of science as to the form of the earth. Some of the
ancient philosophers had taught that the earth is a
sphere, and through the writings of Aristotle the
belief was spread among the scholars of the Middle
Ages.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> That the idea made its way into art is perhaps
because the sphere is the most perfect and
beautiful form, and hence the fitting symbol of
God's created work.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">[23]</a></span>
St. John carries the cross, which is his usual emblem
as a prophet of Christ. It is tall and slender
because it was supposed to be made of reeds. The
reference is to Jesus's words concerning John when
asking the people if they had sought the prophet
merely as "a reed shaken by the wind."</p>

<p>The infant Jesus is a vigorous child, straight and
perfectly formed. The little St. John is an older
and taller boy, wearing a tunic. The younger child
is delighted to have a playfellow. There is an eager
smile on his face, and he puts out his right hand as
if he longed to take the curious plaything St. John
carries. Both children are plump, with well-shaped
heads, but there is nothing precocious-looking about
either. They are indeed uncommonly pretty, but
for the rest are like other children, eying each other
somewhat shyly in the early stages of acquaintance.
It will not be long before they are the best of friends.</p>

<p>The figures in our illustration form a part of a
marble altar-piece by Mino da Fiesole. The whole
composition consists of three niches approached by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">[24]</a></span>
steps. In the central compartment kneels the mother
Mary, adoring with folded hands the child, who
sits below her. We see in our picture only the lower
part of her dress behind the Christ child. In the side
niches are figures of saints, the little St. John kneeling
in front of the one on the Madonna's right.</p>

<p>Mino da Fiesole has been called "The Raphael
of sculpture," and his work in this altar-piece illustrates
the fitness of comparing him with the great
painter. Especially do the figures of the two children
here remind us of the child ideals of Raphael.
At the time when this work was executed (1462)
painters and sculptors had just begun to represent
the Christ child undraped. The earlier artists had
always shown the little figure clad in a tunic. We
shall presently see how this old custom was still followed
in bas-reliefs of the Madonna and Child by
Luca della Robbia and Rossellino. The more progressive
artists were unwilling to conceal the beauty
of the child's figure by any sort of dress. By the
beginning of the sixteenth century the old way had
entirely given place to the new.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In our picture we see that a Latin inscription on
the base of the lowest step contains the name of
Leonardo Salutati, bishop of Fiesole.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It was by the
order of this bishop that the altar was executed, as
was also the tomb opposite it in the cathedral of
Fiesole.</p>

<h3>BOYS WITH CYMBALS</h3>
<h3>BY LUCA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>

<p>The bas-relief of our illustration is one of a series
of marble panels designed to ornament the singing-gallery
of a church. The children moving forward
with song and cymbal remind us of the bands of
singers and musicians who took part in religious
processions of ancient times. We read of such processions
among both the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The custom of singing was adopted by the Christian
church from its foundation,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and gradually the
musical part of the service was developed into a fine
art. There was a famous system of choral chanting
under Pope Gregory I.,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and in the eleventh century
part singing was introduced. At length the organ
came into use, and by the fifteenth century it had
become an important part of the church furnishings.</p>

<p>It was early in this century when the wardens of
the cathedral at Florence had an organ constructed
on what the old writer Vasari called "a very grand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">[26]</a></span>
scale." In connection with this an organ loft, such
as the Italians call a <i>cantoria</i>, was needed to accommodate
the singers. The Florentine sculptor, Luca
della Robbia, received the order for this work, and
was occupied with it some nine years (1431-1440).</p>

<p>The cantoria is entirely of marble, built like a balcony,
with the upper part or balustrade supported
on five consoles or brackets. Four square bas-reliefs,
separated by pilasters, ornament the front of
the balustrade, and four more fill the corresponding
spaces below, separated by the consoles. The artist
took as the motive of his decorative scheme the one
hundred and fiftieth psalm. This hymn of praise
furnished his imagination with a series of pictures
illustrating many kinds of music. The entire psalm
is quoted in the Latin version on the gallery, the
inscriptions running in narrow bands across the top
and bottom and between the two rows of panels.
These are the verses in the familiar English version
of King James, grouped in the three sections into
which they are divided:--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Praise God in his sanctuary:</span>
<span class="i1">praise him in the firmament of his power.</span>
<span class="i0">Praise him for his mighty acts:</span>
<span class="i1">praise him according to his excellent greatness.</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br><br></span>
<span class="i0">Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:</span>
<span class="i1">praise him with the psaltery and harp.</span>
<span class="i0">Praise him with the timbrel</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br><br></span>
<span class="i3">and dance:</span>
<span class="i1">praise him with stringed instruments and organs.</span>
<span class="i0">Praise him upon the loud cymbals:</span>
<span class="i1">praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.</span>
<span class="i0">Let everything that hath breath</span>
<span class="i4">praise the Lord."</span>

The eight illustrations of the gallery omit nothing
mentioned by the psalmist. Here are the trumpets,
the harp, the psaltery, and the timbrel. Here is the
choric dance, followed by players on organs and
stringed instruments; after these come the loud cymbals
or tambourines, and finally the "high sounding
cymbals" of our illustration.</p>

<p>The players are a half dozen children, some dressed
in tunics, and others wearing scarf-like garments
which leave their limbs free. Two are crowned with
flowers in the Greek fashion, and others have a fillet
or band bound about the hair. The leader walks
with his head thrown back, his mouth wide open,
singing with all his might, oblivious of everything
but his music. He holds the cymbals high, striking
them together in the rhythm of his song. His companion
is a jolly little fellow, not at all concerned in
the music, but laughing at something which attracts
his attention in the distance.</p>

<p>There is another rogue just behind the leader.
Without losing step he throws his weight forward
on bending knee, putting his ear to the upper cymbal.
He is evidently amusing himself with the lingering
vibrations of the metal. The flower-crowned
boy bringing up the rear smiles at us cheerily, as he
steps along, clashing his cymbals with right good-will.
The children in the background seem to take
their task more seriously, as if sharing the spirit of
the leader.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">[30]</a></span>
It is clear that our artist found the models for
his figures in the streets of Florence. These round-faced
children with their large mouths are not pretty
enough for imaginary types. They are perfectly
natural, and that is why we like them.</p>

<p>The grouping is skilfully planned to give unity
to the composition without any stiffness. There are
no awkward gaps between the figures, but the lines
flow from one to another, binding them together.
The half kneeling posture of the child in the middle
makes diagonal lines to unite the leader with the
boy in the rear. We notice in the drawing the same
sweep of line which we have admired in Donatello's
bronze reliefs of angels. The three figures in front
are modelled in high relief, and in beautiful curves;
the children in the rear are in low relief.</p>

<p>The work of Luca della Robbia was not confined
to marble. Soon after completing the organ gallery
he made a bronze door for the interior of the cathedral.
He is best known for his work in enamelled
terra-cotta, of which we shall hear more in later
chapters.</p>

<h3>TOMB OF ILARIA DEL CARRETTO</h3>
<h3>(<i>Detail</i>)</h3>
<h3>BY JACOPO DELLA QUERCIA</h3>


<p>A certain marquis of Carretto, living in Lucca
at the close of the fourteenth century, had a daughter
named Ilaria. Ilaria was like Helen of Troy,
"a daughter of the gods, divinely tall and most
divinely fair."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Her face was delicately cut in a
patrician mould, and she carried her head with the
air of a princess. The marquis must have been
proud of his beautiful daughter, and as she grew
into womanhood he looked about for a suitable
match for her. There was little romance about
marriages in those days, and when a rich widower
sought Ilaria's hand, she was doubtless thought by
all a very fortunate maiden.</p>

<p>Her husband, Paolo Guinigi, was the signor or
lord of the city of Lucca, and though somewhat
despotic in temper was at least without vices. He
was besides the richest man in Italy. In his treasury,
says the historian, "diamonds and rubies,
emeralds and pearls, were counted by hundreds."
The palace awaiting the bride was magnificently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">[32]</a></span>
furnished. There was linen from Paris and other
French cities, exquisite in quality and in stores so
abundant as to delight the heart of a housewife.
The walls were hung with tapestries of many colors
woven in Arras. Priceless vessels of gold and
silver adorned the table. Nor were signs of learning
lacking. There was a library, well stocked with
the works of classical authors, written in manuscript
in the manner of the times.</p>

<p>So far as surroundings make for happiness Ilaria
may well have been a happy woman. We like to
fancy her queenly figure moving through the stately
apartments of the palace or on the green terraces
of the garden. But she did not long enjoy the
splendors of her surroundings, for two years after
her marriage she died. Her husband then ordered
of the sculptor Jacopo della Quercia a marble tomb
to be placed in the cathedral. On the sarcophagus
lay the portrait figure of the lady herself; the sides
were richly carved with cherubs holding festoons of
flowers, and above was a canopy.</p>

<p>Ilaria lies with hands crossed just where they
would naturally fall in her sleep.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Her feet rest
against a little dog, which, according to the old
writer, Vasari, was an emblem of conjugal fidelity.
It is surely no harm to fancy that the little creature
was the lady's pet. The gown is girdled high, and
falling in long, straight folds, is wrapped about the
feet. Over this is worn a mantle made with large,
loose sleeves, and a high flaring collar, which comes
well up under the chin.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">[35]</a></span>
Our illustration shows only the head and shoulders
of the figure. The head rests on a pillow in a
hollow shaped to receive it, and the shoulders are
supported by a second and larger cushion underneath.
Ilaria's waving hair is parted over the high
brow, and brought down on each side the face,
completely concealing the ears. A few short tendrils
have escaped, and curl daintily over the forehead.
She wears a large flower-wound wreath or
crown, set aslant over the shapely head. It may be
that this is a sort of head-dress worn in her time.
No one can look at the face without thinking of a
flower, and most of all of the lily. The mouth is
moulded in exquisite curves; Ilaria was, indeed, a
bewitching woman.</p>

<p>Had the fair marchioness lived to middle age her
fortunes would have been sadly altered. In 1430
there was a political upheaval in Lucca, and Guinigi
was driven from the city.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> His palace was pillaged,
and the mob even laid desecrating hands upon
Ilaria's tomb. An attempt to remove it seems to
have been frustrated, and it was dropped on the
floor of the transept, where it now stands. It lost,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">[36]</a></span>
however, the canopy and one ornamented side of
the base.</p>

<p>As a work of art, Ilaria's tomb has been greatly
admired by critics. Even in our little picture we
can, with no great training, see how well the sculptor
has rendered the texture of the hair and the softness
of the plump chin. Even the tassels on the
cushion are carved with clever imitative skill. We
must be careful to look at the face just as the sculptor
intended it to be seen, not upright, but lying
horizontally. It is only thus that we get the significance
of the beautiful continuous line across forehead
and nose. The line of the head-dress exactly
follows that of the hair, and is drawn at the same
angle as the edge of the collar, which it meets. In
the triangular space thus formed is fitted the lovely
profile of the face. Ruskin has written with much
enthusiasm of the merits of Ilaria's tomb. From
it, he declared, one may receive "unerring canon of
what is evermore lovely and right in the dealing of
the art of man with his fate and his passions."
Still more helpful is his interpretation of the feeling
which the sculptor has conveyed. After first
explaining that "every work of the great Christian
schools expresses primarily conquest over death,"
he shows that this particular tomb has "all the peace
of the Christian eternity." We may see, he says,
"that the damsel is not dead but sleepeth; yet as
visibly a sleep that shall know no ending until the
last day break and the last shadows flee away."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<h3>MADONNA AND CHILD</h3>
<h3>(<i>Detail of lunette</i>)</h3>
<h3>BY LUCA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>


<p>In reading the gospel narrative of the life of
Jesus we are glad to learn something of his mother
Mary. Her life had some peculiar hardships to test
the strength of her character. It was a strange lot
for a mother to have to tend her babe in the manger
of an inn, but such was Mary's experience. At the
time of Jesus's birth she and Joseph were in Bethlehem,
whither they had come to pay their taxes.
There were many other people there on the same
errand, and the inn was so crowded that the young
mother had to find quarters in the stable.</p>

<p>While the child was still very young a terrible
danger threatened his life. An order went forth
from King Herod to slay all the young children of
Bethlehem. Still the mother's courage did not fail.
She arose by night, and, taking her babe, fled with
her husband into Egypt. Returning at length to
their home in Nazareth, she watched her boy's
growth, and kept all his sayings in her heart.</p>

<p>When Jesus entered upon his ministry Mary was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">[38]</a></span>
the first to show perfect confidence in her son.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
She seems to have followed him whenever she could.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Her courage sustained her even in the hour of his
agony, and we read how she stood with his disciples
at the foot of the cross.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It is this woman of quiet fortitude whom we see in
Luca della Robbia's bas-relief of the Madonna and
Child. We are impressed at once with a sense of
her strength and poise of character. It is precisely
such as fits the story of her life. Steadying her little
boy with both hands, she turns her face in the direction
in which he is looking. The Child seems to
stand on a sort of balustrade in front of his mother.
With feet wide apart he holds himself erect in a firm
posture. His right hand is raised in a gesture of
benediction. With his left he grasps firmly a long
scroll bearing the Latin inscription, "Ego sum Lux
Mundi" (I am the Light of the World).</p>

<p>Both mother and child seem to belong to the
happy, every-day working world. Mary has the
straight figure, full throat, and square shoulders of
a Tuscan peasant girl. Her only aristocratic feature
is the shapely hand. She holds her chin level, like
a country maiden used to carrying burdens on the
head. It may be that the artist had seen her like
in some market-place in Florence. The boy too has
the square shoulders and sturdy frame of a child of
the people.</p>

Some artists have tried to give a supernatural and
ethereal beauty to the mother and child. Others
have represented them enthroned in splendor like a
queen and prince receiving their court. Luca della
Robbia went to no such extremes. There is nothing
morbid or sentimental in his art: nor does he care
for any worldly pomp and ceremonial. His religious
ideals were very simple, suited to the needs of common
life. The Christ child here is a dear little
human baby, and the Madonna is the poet's ideal
of "a creature not too bright or good for human
nature's daily food."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<a name="DellaRobbiaWare"></a><p>The bas-relief is one of the famous works in enamelled
terra-cotta, known as "Della Robbia ware."
The idea of overlaying clay with a glazing was not
original with Luca della Robbia, but he seems to
have been the first to apply it to sculpture. In his
own day he was looked upon as a great inventor,
and his works were very popular. The material was
inexpensive, and lent itself readily to all sorts of
decorative purposes. Its beauty, moreover, was of a
lasting quality. While paintings fade, the Della
Robbia ware, "gem like, shall as very gems endure."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The only injury to which it is liable is the
breaking off of some projecting portions. In our
picture we see that a fragment is broken out of the
child's wrist. Fortunately, however, there are no
defects in the important parts of the work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">[42]</a></span>
The figures are in the centre of a lunette or semi-circular
composition, with an adoring angel on each
side holding a jar of lilies. The piece is set up over
a doorway on the outside of a building in a narrow
street in Florence. The location explains the attitude
of the mother and child. If they looked directly
out of the picture as in an altar-piece, there
would be but one place, on the opposite side of the
street, where the passer-by could meet their eyes.
As it is, they turn their faces toward the vista of
the street as if to welcome the approaching wayfarer.
While still a long way off one feels the cheerful
influence of their gaze. Even when coming from
the opposite direction it is pleasant, after passing the
door, to know that the friendly eyes follow us on
our way.</p>

<p>The workmanship of Luca is seen in the artistic
qualities of the sculpture. There was a severe
simplicity in his drawing of the outline and draperies
which contrasted with the more elaborate work
of his followers. Luca was also a close student of
nature, and drew his materials from the world about
him.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>THE MEETING OF ST. FRANCIS AND ST. DOMINICK</h3>
<h3>BY ANDREA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>

<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century two
men living in different countries of Europe were
struck simultaneously with the same idea. They
were St. Dominick, the Spaniard, and St. Francis,
the Italian, and each determined to found a new
religious order.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Hitherto the members of religious
orders had shut themselves up in the solitude of
monasteries and convents. In the new plan they
were to mingle freely with the people, calling themselves
brothers, or friars.</p>

<p>The first object of the Dominicans was to be
preachers, and they were called Frati Predicatori.
The Franciscans took the humbler name of the Frati
Minori, or lesser brothers. The members of both
orders were bound by a vow of poverty to possess
nothing of their own. Like the disciples whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">[44]</a></span>
Jesus sent out, they were to carry neither purse nor
scrip, but beg their food and raiment on their way.
It is for this that they are called mendicant orders.</p>

<p>The affairs of their orders brought both St. Dominick
and St. Francis to Rome at the same time.
The two men met and embraced, each seeing in the
other a kindred spirit. It was proposed to unite the
two bodies in one, and St. Dominick favored this
plan. He had won but a few followers, and St.
Francis already had many. The Brother Minor
however was sure that such union would be impossible.
The two men were indeed of widely contrasting
characters. St. Dominick was a scholar, a man
of fiery and energetic temperament. St. Francis
was unlettered, but his mind was poetic and imaginative,
his nature gentle and humble. St. Dominick
was known as the "Hammer of the Heretics," St.
Francis as the "Father of the Poor."</p>

<p>A bas-relief by Andrea della Robbia represents
the meeting of St. Dominick with St. Francis.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It
is apparently the artist's intention to emphasize the
kinship rather than the contrast between the two
men. Both have the thin faces and sharp features
of the ascetic. Their shaven faces and tonsured
heads heighten the resemblance between them.
Both have the same type of hand, with the long
fingers which are characteristic of a sensitive nature.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
A disc over the head of each symbolizes his saintliness.</p>

Naturally the characters of the founders were impressed
upon their respective orders. The Dominicans
were more aggressive in their methods and
zealous in persecuting all forms of heresy. The
Franciscans, on the other hand, strove for the higher
life of sanctity. The members of each order wore a
distinctive dress, such as we see in our picture. The
Franciscan habit was at first gray, and afterwards
dark brown; it is gray in the bas-relief. It consisted
of a plain tunic with long loose sleeves and
a scanty cape to which a hood was attached. A
knotted cord fastened the garment around the waist,
to remind the wearer that the body is a beast which
should be subdued by a halter. The Dominican
habit was a white woollen gown fastened about the
waist with a girdle. A white scapular was worn
over this, and over all, a black cloak with a hood.</p>

<p>We see at once in our picture that St. Dominick
is the elder of the two men. There was really a
difference of twenty years in their ages, but the
artist has made it less. It is as if each, upon seeing
the other approach, had hastened forward with
outstretched hands. They stand now face to face
with interlocked arms in mutual contemplation. It
is a moment of perfect understanding. With widely
different ideas of ways and means, they have at heart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">[48]</a></span>
a single common aim. Both are called to the same
great work, and each feels strengthened by the
contact.</p>

<p>The profile of St. Francis shows the sensitive lines
of his face. Tradition tells us that he was a man
of more than average height, with black eyes, and
soft sonorous voice. His expression here is serene,
as one would expect of the gentle friar who called
all the beasts his brethren, and talked with the birds
as familiar companions. St. Dominick has a more
strenuous countenance, and is perhaps more deeply
moved than the other. He leans forward and peers
into St. Francis's face with an expression of great
tenderness. One is reminded of a beautiful verse
in one of the Hebrew psalms (the eighty-fifth),
"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness
and peace have kissed each other."</p>

<p>The artistic qualities of this relief place it among
the best works by Andrea della Robbia. Only a
skilful artist could have rendered the draperies with
such grace and simplicity. They have been compared
with the draperies of the painters Raphael
and Bartolommeo. It is said that the faces were
left unglazed in order that all the lines of the modelling
might be preserved.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The lives of both saints are related in <i>The Golden Legend</i>. In
Caxton's translation (Temple Classics) see volume iv., p. 172, for St.
Dominick, and volume v., p. 215, for St. Francis. Mrs. Jameson's
<i>Legends of the Monastic Orders</i> contains an admirable account of the
character and work of the two men. <i>The Little Flowers of St. Francis</i> is
a series of legends collected about two hundred years after his death.
There is an English translation by Abby Langdon Alger. Sabatier's
<i>Life of St. Francis</i> is an exhaustive biography.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> A tradition that St. Francis and St. Dominick met in Florence,
on the site of the present Loggia of S. Paolo, accounts for the placing

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The reader who is familiar with the typical figure of St. Francis
in sacred art may miss the sign of the wound print (the stigmata) in
his hand. Here Andrea is historically accurate, as the vision of St.
Francis occurred four years after the confirmation of the Order.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>ST. GEORGE</h3>
<h3>BY DONATELLO</h3>


<p>In the third century of the present era lived the
Christian knight George of Cappadocia. Going
forth after the usual knightly fashion in search of
adventures, he came to the province of Libya. The
country was at that time ravaged by a dragon whose
lair was a great pond near the royal city of Silene.
When the monster came forth the air was filled with
the poisonous vapor of his breath. To insure the
safety of the city two sheep were daily given to feed
him.</p>

<p>At length the supply failed, and now the people
had to give their own children. The victims were
chosen by lot, and after many had perished the lot
fell upon the beautiful princess Cleodolinda. The
king besought the people to spare his daughter,
offering gold and silver for her ransom. They
would have none of it, but declared that the princess
must meet her fate. Arrayed as for her bridal, she
was led out to the place where the dragon was wont
to come for his prey.</p>

<p>While she stood here weeping, St. George chanced
to ride by and inquired the cause of her distress.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">[50]</a></span>
Hearing her pitiable story he assured her she had
nothing to fear. Just then the dragon came in
sight, and the knight, charging full upon him,
wounded him with his sword. Then taking the
girdle of the princess, he tied it about the neck of
the beast and led him into the city. The people all
came out to see the wonder, and in the presence of
a great company St. George smote off the dragon's
head.</p>

<p>The further adventures of the knight were in
behalf of the Christians, who were persecuted by
the Emperor Diocletian. Selling all that he had, he
gave it to the poor and boldly denounced the pagans.
All sorts of tortures were devised to force him to
renounce his faith, but in every persecution he was
miraculously preserved from harm. At length the
provost caused him to be beheaded, and offering his
last prayers St. George went to his death.</p>

<p>In our statue St. George is represented as a warrior
standing at rest while he surveys the enemy.
His young figure is as straight as an arrow. The
litheness of his body is apparent even through his
armor. He holds his head erect in conscious power,
yet with no arrogance. Evidently he measures the
difficulty carefully, for he seems to knit his brows
as he looks abroad. He has a gentle face, but it
is thoroughly masculine.</p>

<p>The hands are beautiful, and full of character,
large and flexible. The left one rests on a shield
which bears the sign of the cross. The armor, we
see, has a more than literal significance. This is the
"shield of faith" wherewith the Christian shall be
able "to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
St. George is the impersonation of the soldier who
wars "not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places."<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

antique sculpture. We are reminded of Apollo or
Hermes as the Greeks loved to represent them.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
The beautiful head with its curling hair is indeed
that of a god. In the graceful attitude also, the
sculptor, Donatello, has perfectly expressed the sense
of repose which was characteristic of Greek sculpture.
We note, however, that while a Greek statue
would have been nude St. George is clad in armor.
The expression of the countenance is, moreover,
quite foreign to the Greek temper. Those knitted
brows show a strenuousness of character incompatible
with the serenity of the gods.</p>

<p>The statue of St. George, like that of St. Philip,
was originally made to fill one of the niches on the
outside of Or San Michele. Below it was a bas-relief
representing the slaying of the dragon. The
work was the gift of the Guild of Sword Makers and
Armorers, whose patron saint was the Knight of
Cappadocia. In an exposed position on the church
the precious marble was injured by the weather.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">[54]</a></span>
Accordingly it was removed to a museum, and a
bronze copy was set up in its place.</p>

<p>The popularity of St. George is by no means confined
to Italy. In England too his memory is held
in great respect. "For England and St. George"
was an old battle-cry which linked the name of the
patron saint with that of the native land. His character
is our ideal of the Christian hero, chivalrous
towards the weak, courageous in danger, and devoted
above all things to the service of God.</p>

<p>Donatello's statue embodies this ideal, and is his
highest imaginative work. Being chiefly interested
in the study of expression, he often seemed to care
very little whether his subjects were beautiful or not.
Here beauty and expressiveness are united.</p>

<p>There is an old tradition that Michelangelo, passing
one day the church of Or San Michele, paused
before the St. George and exclaimed "Cammina!"
that is, "Forward, march!" The story is doubtless
purely fictitious, but it shows how lifelike the statue
appears. As an old writer (Vasari) put it, "Life
seems to move within that stone."</p>

<h3>BAMBINO</h3>
<h3>BY ANDREA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>


<p>The visitor in Florence threading his way through
the narrow streets comes out with delight into the
spacious squares scattered over the city. One such
is the Piazza of SS. Annunziata, in front of the
church of that name. Two sides of the square are
ornamented with arcaded buildings in the style characteristic
of Italian architecture. That at the left
attracts us at once by its unique decorations. In the
spandrils, or triangular spaces between the arches,
are medallion bas-reliefs of glazed terra cotta showing
white figures relieved against a background of
bright blue. It is one of these which is reproduced
in our illustration. Seen against the sombre wall
they are like "fragments of the milky sky itself
fallen into the cool street," as a poetic critic has
described them.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>From each medallion a baby looks down upon us,
stretching out both little arms as if appealing to our
pity. The delicate beauty of these little ones is so
like that of the flowers that a traveller asks, "Really,
are they lilies, or children, or the embodied strophes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">[56]</a></span>
of a psalter?"<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> When we inquire what it all means
we learn that this arcade is the entrance to a Foundling
Hospital. Passing through the central door
we are in a <i>cortile</i> or courtyard, around which are
more baby figures. The design is a sort of key to
the character of the institution: the babies represent
the little waifs received into its care. We may
fancy that the orphan inmates are peeping out of
the medallions as from windows.</p>

<p>The Hospital of the Innocents (Spedale degli
Innocenti, in Italian) is one of the oldest establishments
of its kind. It was founded in the fifteenth
century, and still carries on its good work. Several
thousand children are annually supported by its resources.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
To multiply the figures by four hundred
and fifty makes a magnificent showing for the total
number of beneficiaries in four and <a name="MissingA"></a><a href="#Typo_Corr">a</a> half centuries.
It was probably on the occasion of some improvements
in the original building (1463) that Andrea
della Robbia furnished the famous medallions of the
<i>bambini</i>, or baby boys.</p>

<p>Among so many babies we yet find no two alike.
Each visitor chooses for himself some special favorite.
The medallion of our illustration is one of the
most attractive of the number. Unfortunately the
fingers of the right hand are broken off, but otherwise
the figure is quite perfect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">[59]</a></span>
The child is a healthy-looking little fellow, and the
creases in neck and wrists show how plump he is.
Yet there is a pathetic expression on the face which
touches the heart. It is as if orphanage had laid
its sorrowful impress upon him. A lonely look has
crept into the eyes, and the mouth droops in a sad
little curve. The boy is certainly no common child.
His finely formed head promises a superior character.
We are reminded of the Christ child, as many of
the old masters have represented him. The body
and legs are completely encased in swaddling bands,
from which the head and arms emerge, like a blossom
from its calyx.</p>

<p>The custom of swathing babies with bandages is
very ancient. We read in the gospel of St. Luke
how the mother of Jesus wrapped her son in swaddling
clothes as she laid him in the manger. The
object was to prevent every possible injury or deformity
to the growing limbs, and keep them
straight. A child in swaddling clothes is naturally
much more easily carried by the mother, and can
more safely be left alone. This is doubtless the reason
why the custom still prevails in many countries,
and especially among the poorer people. There are
still many nations which the progressive ideas of
physical culture have not reached.</p>

<p>The method of swaddling as now practised in
Italy begins by folding the babe in a large square
linen cloth. A second piece of linen is rolled around
the body, which is then ready for the bandage.
This bandage is about ten inches wide and over
three yards long, and is rolled about the entire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">[60]</a></span>
length of the child's figure, pinning the arms to the
sides. The lower part of the linen cloth is turned
up over the feet and tied with the ends of the bandage.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Judging from our picture, the process seems to
have been about the same in the fifteenth century,
except that the arms of our bambino are free. Certainly
this fact makes the figure much more attractive
as well as more decorative. The cloth about the
child's body is brown and the bandage white.</p>

<p>The sculptor of the bambini, Andrea della Robbia,
was the nephew of Luca della Robbia, of whom
we have learned something in previous chapters.
He was trained in the workshop of his uncle, and in
turn passed on his art to his three sons. While
Luca's work is considered superior to that of any of
his pupils, the nephew Andrea had some fine artistic
qualities. The decorations of the Foundling Hospital
illustrate both the delicacy and the fertility of
his imagination. Only a genuine artist could invent
so many variations upon the simple theme of a single
baby figure. The entire series is like a musical
composition based upon some simple but exquisite
melody.</p>

<h3>THE ANNUNCIATION</h3>
<h3>BY ANDREA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>


<p>The life of Mary the mother of Jesus was full of
strange experiences. She had many sorrows to bear,
but withal a joy beyond any ever given to woman.
In the purity of her character she was set apart for
a high and holy service.</p>

<p>The turning-point in her life was on a great day
when the angel Gabriel was sent by God to visit
her. It was in her quiet home in Nazareth that the
celestial messenger "came in unto her." "Hail,
thou that art highly favoured," he said, "the Lord
is with thee: blessed art thou among women."
"And when she saw him, she was troubled at his
saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation
this should be."</p>

<p>The angel spoke again, and his words reassured
her: "Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour
with God." Then he told her that she was to be
the mother of a wonderful son. "Thou shalt call
his name Jesus," he said. "He shall be great, and
shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the
Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his
father David: and he shall reign over the house of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">[62]</a></span>
Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be
no end."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>When at last Mary understood the meaning of
the angel's message she humbly accepted her great
destiny. "Behold the handmaid of the Lord," she
replied; "be it unto me according to thy word."
From this day until the birth of Jesus her thoughts
were full of her coming motherhood. Once she
broke forth into a song of praise:--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span>
<span class="i0">And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,</span>
<span class="i0">For he hath regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden,</span>
<span class="i0">For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span>
<span class="i0">For he that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is his name."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bas-relief by Andrea della Robbia tells the
story of the angel's visit to Mary, the subject usually
called the Annunciation. At one side sits the Virgin
with an open book on her lap, as if she had been
reading. She has a girl's slender figure, and her
head is modestly draped with a mantle. The angel
kneels opposite, with folded hands. He has long
pointed wings covered with feathers as "a bird of
God," in Dante's phrase.</p>

<p>From above a fatherly face looks down upon them
out of a surrounding circle of winged cherub heads.
Beside the Virgin stands a jar of lilies, the flowers
which symbolize the purity of her maidenhood.
Over these soars a white dove, the same symbol of
the Divine Spirit which descended upon Jesus at his
baptism.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

Already the angel has delivered his message, and
now awaits the answer. His face is round and innocent
like a child's, and his long hair is carefully
curled. The Virgin has listened with drooping head,
and with her hand pressed to her breast as if to still
the beating of her heart. She seems too timid to
lift her eyes to meet her radiant guest. Yet her
whole attitude expresses submission to the divine
will.</p>

<p>The artist has expressed with rare delicacy of imagination
the religious sentiment of the incident.
The interpretation is in a similar vein to that of the
poet painter Rossetti in the lines on the Annunciation
in the poem "Ave:"--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then suddenly the awe grew deep<br></span>
<span class="i0">As of a day to which all days<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were footsteps in God's secret ways;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Until a folding sense, like prayer,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which is, as God is, everywhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gathered about thee; and a voice<br></span>
<span class="i0">Spake to thee without any noise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Being of the silence:--'Hail,' it said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Thou that art highly favour&eacute;d;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord is with thee, here and now;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed among all women thou.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rossetti, it will be remembered, belonged to that
circle of English artists who some fifty years ago attempted
to revive the simple reverence of the Italian
art previous to Raphael. Thus the "Pre-Raphaelite"
poet and the sculptor, though separated by so
many centuries, had the common aim of expressing
"the sense of prayer" which gathered about the
Virgin in this moment. Rossetti also treated the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">[66]</a></span>
Annunciation in a picture which has interesting
points of comparison with our illustration.</p>

<p>The relief is made in the Della Robbia enamelled
terra cotta ware<a name="MissingP"></a><a href="#Typo_Corr">.</a> The sculptor has here followed
his uncle's example in the simplicity of the draperies.
The modelling of the hands also recalls the touch
of Luca. In choice of types, however, Andrea shows
his individual taste. The fragile figure of the Virgin
is as different as possible from the robust beauty
of Luca's Madonna which we have studied. The
angel too is of a softer and less vigorous character
than the older artist would have designed.</p>

<p>The relief is surrounded by an elaborate frame of
the same material. At the sides decorated pillars
with Ionic capitals support an entablature, every section
of which has its own distinctive design. The
patterns ornamenting frieze and pillars seem to be
variations on the lotus motive, and are very graceful.
On the dado, or piece running across the bottom
of the frame, is printed the Latin inscription:
"Ecce Ancilla Domini. Fiat Mihi secundum verbum
tuum" (Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be
it done unto me according to thy word). It is interesting
to notice that at this period the letters <i>n</i> and
<i>m</i> were written above the line or united with the
vowels which they followed.</p>

<h3>THE ASCENSION</h3>
<h3>BY LUCA DELLA ROBBIA</h3>

<p>For forty days after the resurrection of Jesus the
disciples enjoyed the companionship of their Master.
They were now ready to understand many things
that before had been obscure to them, and Jesus
spoke to them much of the things pertaining to the
Kingdom of God.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Sometimes, as they sat together,
he suddenly appeared among them.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Once when
a few of them had been out fishing over night they
found him standing on the shore in the morning.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Still later he appointed a meeting on a mountain
in Galilee at which over five hundred of the faithful
were gathered. It was then that he commanded
them to go forth to teach all nations, and he gave
them the promise, "Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Finally he led the chosen band to the Mount of
Olives at Bethany, "and he lifted up his hands
and blessed them. And it came to pass while he
blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried
up into heaven." "And a cloud received him out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">[68]</a></span>
their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward
heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by
them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men
of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
him go into heaven."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In Luca della Robbia's bas-relief of the Ascension
the moment has come when, in the very act of
blessing his disciples, Jesus is parted from them.
He had already, in some measure, prepared them
for this event. On the day of his resurrection he
told them that he was about to ascend to his father.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
To-day his words and manner may have shown them
that the time was at hand. Certainly there are no
startled or grief-stricken faces among them; no gestures
of surprise. It is as if in response to some
sign from the master, they had all knelt to receive
his benediction, and while they were still on their
knees, he rose from their midst. Already his feet
have left the solid earth, as he vanishes out of their
sight.</p>

<p>The company form a circle just as they had
clustered about him. So orderly is their arrangement,
so quietly is the great act accomplished, that
they seem to be taking part in some religious service.
All eyes are fixed upon the Saviour, with love,
joy, and adoration expressed in every countenance.</p>

<p>The treachery of Judas had reduced the number
of disciples to eleven, and the vacant place was not
filled until later. We see, however, twelve figures
in this circle, and notice that one is a woman. This
is Mary, the mother of Jesus, who had lived with
John since the day of the Crucifixion. It was the
express wish of Jesus that the beloved disciple
should regard her as a mother. Thus it is not
unnatural to suppose that the two would come
together to Bethany at this time, and kneel side by
side, as we see them here. Mary looks as young
as when she held her babe in her arms, and she has
the same happy expression. It is not possible to
make out who the others are. We fancy that the
two beardless young men at the right are Thomas
and Philip, because they are thought to have been
younger than the other disciples.</p>

<p>The figure of the Saviour is noble and dignified,
the attitude full of buoyancy. The face is such
as from long association we have come to identify
with the person of Christ, benignant and refined.
He looks not up into the glory towards which he is
ascending, but his glance still lingers upon the disciples
with an expression of tender solicitude. An
oval frame of radiating lines surrounds his entire
figure. It is the <i>mandorla</i>, or almond-shaped nimbus,
which was the old artistic symbol of divine
glory.</p>

<p>We have already noticed some of the <a href="#DellaRobbiaWare">characteristics
of Luca della Robbia's art</a>, which are again
illustrated in this work. The draperies are arranged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">[72]</a></span>
with a simplicity of line which is almost severe.
The folds are scanty, clinging to the figure and
following the fine outlines of the pose. The figures
are white, set off against the blue of the sky, and
green, brown, and yellow are introduced in the landscape
surroundings.</p>

<p>The bas-relief is one of two lunettes placed over
opposite doors in the cathedral of Florence. The
companion subject is the Resurrection, and in both
pieces the sculptor went beyond his usual limit in
the number of figures making up the composition.
The leading quality of his work is decorative, and
he seldom applied his art to the illustration of story.
We are the more interested in his remarkable success
in these instances.</p>

<p>A painter would naturally have brought out the
more dramatic features of the Ascension, showing
the excitement and confusion of the moment. Luca
knew well that sculpture was unsuited for violent
action, and he sought rather to convey a sense of
repose in his work. Moreover he infused a devotional
spirit into the scene which he seldom attained.
Marcel-Reymond says that only in Fra Angelico's
work can one find figures expressing such an ecstasy
of love and devotion.</p>

<h3>TOMB OF THE CARDINAL OF PORTUGAL</h3>
<h3>BY ANTONIO ROSSELLINO</h3>

<p>In the church of San Miniato, on a hill overlooking
Florence, is a memorial chapel built in honor of
a Portuguese cardinal who is buried here. Architecture,
painting, and sculpture are here united to
make a perfect artistic whole. The room was designed
by the architect Antonio Manetti; the altar
and walls are adorned with paintings by Pollaiuolo
and Baldovinetti, the roof is decorated with medallions
of Delia Robbia ware, and at one side is the
cardinal's tomb.</p>

<p>This prelate, Jacopo di Portogallo, died in Florence
while visiting the city on a diplomatic mission.
He was a young man under thirty years of age, a
cousin of the reigning king of Portugal, and was
besides the cardinal archbishop of Lisbon. Naturally
he was received as a guest of unusual distinction,
and his amiable qualities won him warm friends
among the Florentines. Though dying in a foreign
land, he was buried with such honors as his own
countrymen could hardly have surpassed. This was
in 1459, at a time when Antonio Rossellino was a
prominent sculptor of Tuscany. He was the artist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">[74]</a></span>
chosen by the Bishop of Florence to construct the
Portuguese cardinal's tomb.</p>

<p>On a richly carved base stands the sarcophagus
or marble coffin in an arched niche. Just over this,
on a bier, lies the portrait figure of the cardinal in
his ecclesiastical robes. All this is surrounded by
a square framework, not unlike a mantelpiece in
style, on the two upper corners of which are kneeling
angels. The wall space above is ornamented by
angels holding over a simulated window a medallion
containing a Madonna and child.</p>

<p>Our illustration shows this portion of the wall,
and includes a part of the angel figures kneeling at
the upper corners of the tomb. The angel on the
left side holds the crown, which is the reward of a
faithful life. It is the "crown of righteousness,"
the "crown of life," or the "crown of glory which
fadeth not away."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> His companion must once have
carried a palm branch, according to an old description,
but this has disappeared. The angels bearing
the medallion fly forward as if swimming through
the air, alternately bending the knee and thrusting
out the leg. Their draperies flutter about them in
the swiftness of their motion. Such vigorous action
is an unusual motive in decorative art, and perhaps
not altogether appropriate. All four of the angels
have delicate features and sweet expressions.</p>

The medallion is, artistically considered, the loveliest
portion of the whole work. The face of the Madonna
is of that perfect oval which artists choose
for their ideal of beauty. We admire too the delicately
cut features, the waving hair, and the shapely
hands. Both she and the child look down from their
high frame, smiling upon those who may stand on
the pavement below. The child raises his hand in
a gesture of benediction, the three fingers extended
as a sign of the trinity.</p>

<p>It is not an easy problem to fit the compositional
lines of a group into a circular frame. Rossellino
solved it very prettily by outlining the figures in a
diamond-shaped diagram. You may easily trace the
four sides, drawing one line from the Madonna's
head along her right shoulder, another from her
elbow to the finger tip, a third from the child's
toes to his left elbow, a fourth from his elbow to the
top of the mother's veil.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that in the whole decorative
scheme of the monument there is nothing to suggest
the idea of mourning. There is here no sense
of gloom in the presence of death. The rejoicing of
the angels, the smile of the mother and child, and
the peaceful sleep of the cardinal, all express the
Christian hope of immortality beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The sentiment is particularly appropriate to the
character of the man whose memory is honored here.
The Florentine writer Vespasiano Bisticci described
him as being "of a most amiable nature, a pattern
of humanity, and an abundant fountain of good,
through God, to the poor.... He lived in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">[78]</a></span>
flesh as if he were free from it, rather the life of an
angel than a man, and his death was holy as his
life."<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Allowing something for the extravagance of
speech which was the fashion of that time, we may
still believe that the Cardinal of Portugal was a man
whose character was singularly pure in an age when
good men were none too common. Of the sculptor
Rossellino also fair words are spoken. Vasari declared
that he "was venerated almost as a saint for
the admirable virtues which he added to his knowledge
of art."</p>

<p>The custom of erecting elaborate marble tombs
was an interesting feature of the Renaissance art
in Italy. Such monuments formed an important
part of the interior decoration of churches. Church
dignitaries took great pride in the thought that
their names would be immortalized in these works of
art. Some had their tombs made while still living,
that they might make sure of a satisfactory design.
<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Others gave directions on the subject with their
dying breath, as in Browning's poem, "The Bishop
Orders his Tomb at St. Praxed's." Of the many fine
tombs in the churches of Tuscany, this monument
of the Cardinal of Portugal is counted one of the
three best.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<h3>EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF GATTAMELATA</h3>
<h3>BY DONATELLO</h3>


<p>In the fifteenth century Italy was divided into
numerous independent states, among which there was
more or less rivalry. The two great powers of the
north were Venice and Milan, both striving for the
possession of Lombardy. To the Venetian republic
already belonged an extensive territory on the
mainland, and she was determined on conquest at
any cost. To this end condottieri were employed to
carry on the several campaigns.</p>

<p>These condottieri were military leaders who made
war a business. It mattered nothing to them on
what side they fought or against what enemy, so
long as they were well paid for their services. As
a rule they were men of unscrupulous character,
many of whom betrayed the cause entrusted to
them. To this rule a notable exception was Gattamelata,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
the subject of the equestrian statue in our
illustration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The man's real name was Erasmo da Narni. It
was as first lieutenant in the Venetian army that he
came into notice, serving under Gonzaga. When
later this Gonzaga went over to the cause of the
Milanese enemy, the lieutenant was promoted to the
command. He threw into the work before him,
says the historian, "an honest heart and splendid
faculties."</p>

<p>The Milanese army was much larger than the
Venetian, and was commanded by the famous strategist
Niccol&ograve; Piccinino. Gattamelata could make
little headway against such odds, but all that was
possible to do he accomplished "with equal courage,
fidelity, and zeal." At length, in attempting to
bring relief to the besieged city of Brescia, he
found himself shut in between the Lake of Garda
and the Alps.</p>

<p>It was in the month of September, 1438. Snow
already lay on the mountains, and the rivers were
swollen with the autumn rains. The roads were
out of repair, bridges were washed away, and even
the fords were impassable. To make matters worse,
the army was short of provisions. Such conditions
would have forced any other general to lay down
his arms, but not Gattamelata. With admirable
coolness, he led his men in a retreat across the
mountains and around the lake. Three thousand
horsemen and two thousand infantry made up their
number, and all were devoted to their leader. Torrents
were bridged, old roads repaired, new ones
opened, and at the end of a month the army
emerged upon the Lombard plain.</p>

Thus were the Venetian arms saved, and at the
same time the Milanese were baffled in a design to
come between Venice and her army. Gattamelata's
retreat was a victory of peace, less showy, perhaps,
than a victory of war, but requiring the finest qualities
of generalship. In recognition of his services
the Venetian Signory conferred the title of nobility
upon him, with a palace and a pension.</p>

<p>In the following year, the Venetian cause was
strengthened by alliance with Florence, and Gattamelata
yielded the first place in command to Sforza,
the general of the Florentine forces. In 1440 the
united armies succeeded in relieving Brescia, but in
the same year a calamity befell Gattamelata. Exposure
to cold brought on paralysis, and after a
lingering illness of two years he died. The honor
of a great funeral was accorded him at the public
expense, and he was buried in the church of S.
Antonio at Padua. The next year the sculptor,
Donatello, was commissioned to make an equestrian
statue of the great condottiere to be set up in the
square in front of the church.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>With quiet dignity Gattamelata rides forward on
his horse as if reviewing his army. There is nothing
pompous in his attitude or manner. He seems a
plain man intent upon his task, with no thought of
display. He has the strong face of one born for
leadership, and we can believe the stories of his
troops' devotion to him. With his right hand he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
lifts his wand in a gesture of command, letting it
rest across the horse's neck.</p>

<p>He is dressed in the picturesque war costume of
the period, and wears metal plates upon his arms.
A long sword swings at his side, and spurs are
attached to his heels. Yet apparently he is not
actually equipped for the battle, for his head is
uncovered. He has a high receding forehead and
thick curls. The peculiar shape of the head, looking
almost conical from some points of view, indicates
a forcible character. It is evident that this
is a man of action rather than of words. His
appearance fits admirably the facts of his life as
one whose energy and courage could overcome any
obstacle. Gattamelata was not a patriot, as we
understand patriotism, being but a mercenary captain.
But he showed a rare loyalty to the cause he
espoused. It is not as a fighting man that we
admire him to-day, but as a man of remarkable
resources.</p>

<p>Obedient to the master's hand, the horse ambles
at a moderate pace. Except the bridle, he has no
trappings, and we thus see to the best advantage the
fine proportions of his figure. Before undertaking
this work Donatello had had no experience in modelling
the horse, and his success is the more remarkable.
It is, however, the man rather than the horse
which shows the full power of the sculptor's art.
The subject was one exactly suited to his taste,
which preferred vigorous masculine qualities to all
others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
In ancient sculpture equestrian subjects were very
important. On the Parthenon at Athens a frieze
of bas-relief contained rows of horsemen riding in
the Panathenaic procession.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In a public square in
Rome was a famous statue of the Emperor Marcus
Aurelius on horseback. Donatello was the first
sculptor of the Christian era to revive this noble
form of art. The statue of Gattamelata is therefore
the parent of the long line of modern equestrian
statues.</p>

<h3>SHRINE</h3>
<h3>BY MINO DA FIESOLE</h3>

<p>We have seen from the examples in our collection
that the art of sculpture may be applied in
many forms to the decoration of churches, without
and within. Statues like those in the niches on the
church of Or San Michele, sculptured altars like
that by Donatello in the church at Padua, organ
galleries like that by Luca della Robbia in the
Florence cathedral, monumental tombs like those of
Ilaria del Carretto and the Cardinal of Portugal,
medallions and lunettes on walls and ceilings, are
among the treasures enriching the churches of
Italy.</p>

<p>Sculpture may also be used to ornament almost
every article of church furnishing: pulpits, fonts,
and basins for holy water, wardrobes and cabinets,
chests and chairs, as well as a multitude of those
smaller objects wrought in metal which belong to
the goldsmith's art. Upon all such things as these
the Italian artists of the fifteenth century spent
much careful and loving labor.</p>

Our illustration shows a kind of church furniture
common in this period. It is a sculptured cabinet
to contain articles used in the altar services, such as
the sacramental wafers or the holy oil. A receptacle
for objects so sacred is called a shrine. The
architectural framework is in the form styled a
tabernacle, <a href="#StPhilip_img">such as we have seen</a> in the niches on
the outside of Or San Michele.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The artist was Mino da Fiesole, whose decorative
works were very popular, both for the delicacy of
their finish and the quality of sentiment they expressed.
His idea here was to make the design
suggest a sacred story, the story of Christ's resurrection.
The opening into the cabinet is the entrance
of the tomb, and without, the angels await
the coming of the risen Lord.</p>

<p>Our thoughts turn to the Sunday morning in the
garden of Joseph of Arimathea, when the faithful
women came to the rock-hewn tomb. The stone
had been rolled away, and angels greeted them with
the glad tidings, "He is risen."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The angels of
our picture press forward eagerly to peer into the
shadowy depths of the interior. There are two who
are close to the door, while two more, with long
torches, stand on the step below. Above the door
hovers a dove, the emblem of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Various features of the tabernacle illustrate characteristic
qualities of the Italian art of this period.
The arched top is to be noticed as much more common
in Italy than the Gothic or pointed roof. The
winged cherub heads were a favorite decorative
design. We have seen one example of their use in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the frame of the medallion on the <a href="#TombCard_img">Portuguese cardinal's
tomb</a>. The decorated side pillars with Ionic
capitals we have seen in the altarpiece of the <a href="#Annunciation_img">Annunciation</a>
by Andrea della Robbia.</p>

<p>The shrine of our illustration was originally made
for the nuns of the convent of the Murate. It is
mentioned by Vasari as a work which the artist
"conducted to perfection with all the diligence of
which he was capable." That its first purpose was
to hold the sacramental wafers we may be sure
from the Latin inscription, "This is the living
bread which came down from heaven." The words
are those used by our Lord himself in one of the
discourses recorded by St. John.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In 1815 the shrine was removed to its present
place in the church of S. Croce, Florence, where it
is in the chapel of the Medici, also called the chapel
of the Novitiate.</p>

<h3>IL MARZOCCO (THE HERALDIC LION OF FLORENCE)</h3>
<h3>BY DONATELLO</h3>

<p>In the history of the several cities of Italy every
town has chosen some design to be inscribed upon
a shield as a coat of arms. Florence has the lily,
as a reminder of the far-away days when the valley
of the Arno was filled with the red blossoms of the
amaryllis. It was for this that the name <i>Firenze</i>
was given to the city, the "City of Flowers." The
lily is drawn in three petals somewhat like those of
the fleur-de-lis of France; but the Florentine flower
is broader than its French counterpart, and has besides
two slender flower-stalks separating the larger
petals. When represented in color it is always red.</p>

<p>The tutelary genius of Florence is the lion. He
stands for the noble and heroic qualities in the
Florentine citizen. Courage and patriotism have
many a time been magnificently illustrated in the
history of the city's struggles against tyranny.
Like the king of beasts, the loyal Florentine prefers
death to the loss of liberty.</p>

<p>The choice of the lion as a civic emblem explains
the fact that a preserve of lions was once kept in
Florence at the public expense. This was given up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
centuries ago, but the Via de' Leoni, or street of
the lions, remains to remind us of the old custom.
There was still another way in which Florence
kept the emblem continually before the minds of
her people. This was in the stone lion called the
<a href="#Frontispiece"><i>Marzocco</i></a>, set up in the piazza, or square, of the
Signoria.</p>

<p>For many years the civic life of Florence centred
in the Piazza della Signoria, where stands the old
gray stone palace called the Palazzo Vecchio. Of
some of the important events which took place here
in the fifteenth century we may read in George
Eliot's "Romola." It was here the Florentines
gathered on all occasions of public interest, whether
connected with the political or the religious affairs
of their city.</p>

<p>In front of the Palazzo Vecchio is a stone platform
called the <i>ringhiera</i>, and it was on this that
the Marzocco was set up as a stimulus to patriotism.
The lion sits on his haunches in an attitude of
grave dignity. In this position he is much more
alert than a crouching lion, and less aggressive than
the rampant lion. His duty is to guard the honor
of the city, and his pose is much like that of the
watchdog. With his right paw he supports a shield
on which the Florentine lily is engraved. We are
reminded of our own national eagle holding the
shield of the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>In such a figure we do not look for a close resemblance
to nature. The subjects of heraldic art are
treated in a decorative way with a certain stiffness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of form. The device of the lily is not an actual
picture of the flower, but a kind of floral diagram,
or what we call a conventionalized form. So, too,
the lion is of a formal or emblematic type. Yet
there is a certain expressiveness in the face of the
old fellow which makes us like him. Like the
winged lion of St. Mark's in Venice, he has made
many friends.</p>

<p>Il Marzocco is carved out of soft gray stone which
the Italians call <i>pietra serena</i>. It is believed to
have been made by Donatello, and it stands on a
beautiful carved pedestal. Like the same sculptor's
statue of St. George it was deemed too precious to
leave exposed in the open air, and was therefore
removed to a museum. A bronze copy now stands
in its place on the platform of the old palace.</p>
